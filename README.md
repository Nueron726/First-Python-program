# First-Python-program
This runs Python 2.7 which a majority of large companies use as infrastructure. My computer Science professor suggested that this version is best to use as its most likely we'll encounter it in the workplace. 
This program is a quiz on genetics. I was able to study for my major in Nueroscience all the while practicing my coding skills. This is a simple program.
